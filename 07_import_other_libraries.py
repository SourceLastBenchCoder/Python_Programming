# Others libraries are used with the help of import keyword
# In this example we use built in library called os, with this we can use some functions like
# clear screen - Console, list all files in present directory

# import os
import os

# Clearing the console output
os.system('cls')

print("===============WELCOME TO PYTHON WORLD===============")

# List all files
print(os.listdir())
